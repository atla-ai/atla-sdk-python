            "1. **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**: These are often considered a first-line treatment for anxiety. Common SSRIs include:\n",

            "   - Fluoxetine (Prozac)\n",
            "   - Escitalopram (Lexapro)\n",

            "   - Duloxetine (Cymbalta)\n",

            "   - Alprazolam (Xanax)\n",

            "5. **Beta-Blockers**: While not typically used to treat anxiety disorders, beta-blockers like propranolol can help manage physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heart rate or trembling.\n",
